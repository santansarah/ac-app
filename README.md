Choosing energy efficient products like high SEER rated window air conditioners and energy star certified electronics and appliances can help you save money on your monthly electric bill and ultimately pay for themselves over time.

I built this API for Energy Efficient Buys to showcase my development and technical writing skills. It's written in Visual Studio Code using Node JS and Express.
